Mastering the Coding Interview

- Big 0 and the scalabiltiy of code depends on how much our algorithm slows down based on our input.

Rules for BIG O:
1. Always assume worst case
2. Remove Constants
3. Different inputs should have different variables O(a + b) or nested arrays O(a * b)
4. Drop non-dominant terms
